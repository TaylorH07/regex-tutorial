# Title| Regex Tutorial

## Introductory paragraph

    - What is Regex? or in other words, what is Regular Expression? It is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. It is useful when extracting information from text, or to find certain patterns within a string. However, it is widely used to validate input.

## Summary

- Matching an Email â€“ /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
  - A Regex that matches all possible emails does not exist, but one that matches 99.9% of emails does. It a good practice to validate emails using regex, this will limit the user input upfront. For example, the growing mandatory usage of gmail.com and yahoo.com, which may run into scalability issues.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

    - Anchors are not used to match a character, however they are used to match a position before, in-between, or after characters. The caret ^ is used for the character before the string, the $ is used to match with the last character of the string.
    - When there is a string with multiple lines, line are typically written first line\nsecond line (where \n indicates a line break). The ^ and $ and still be placed before and after the line-break (/n)
