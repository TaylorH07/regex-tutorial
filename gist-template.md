# Title| Regex Tutorial

## Introductory paragraph

    - What is Regex? or in other words, what is Regular Expression? It is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. It is useful when extracting information from text, or to find certain patterns within a string. However, it is widely used to validate input.

## Summary

- Matching an Email â€“ /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
  - A Regex that matches all possible emails does not exist, but one that matches 99.9% of emails does. It a good practice to validate emails using regex, this will limit the user input upfront. For example, the growing mandatory usage of gmail.com and yahoo.com, which may run into scalability issues.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

    - Anchors are not used to match a character, however they are used to match a position before, in-between, or after characters. The caret ^ is used for the character before the string, the $ is used to match with the last character of the string.
    - When there is a string with multiple lines, line are typically written first line\nsecond line (where \n indicates a line break). The ^ and $ and still be placed before and after the line-break (/n)

### Quantifiers

    - When encountered in a regular expression pattern, the regular expression engine interprets the *, +, ?, {, and } characters as quantifiers or part of quantifier constructs unless they are included in a character class.
        - The ? is a greedy quantifier matches the preceding element 0 or 1 time, which is equal to {0,1}
        - The {n} is a greedy quantifier that matches the n times, the lazy quantifier for this is {n}?. EX: the regular expression will look like  \ban?\b
        - The + is a greedy quantifier that matches a preceding element 1 or more times, which is equal to {1, }. EX: the regular expression will look like  \ban+\w*?\b
        - The * is a greedy quantifier that matches the preceding element zero or more times, it is equivalent to {0, }
